# Packages
This git repo contains 4 ROS packages for making up a complete xbot ROS bringup. They are xbot_driver, xbot_dock_drive, xbot_ftdi, xbot_keyop, xbot_msgs,xbot_node and xbot_safety_controller.

## xbot_driver
xbot_driver is the basic package of xbot_bringup. It provides the serial communication with the xbot move base including get sensors data and post the command data from navigation algorithms. 
There ars some test tools such as simple_keyop for you to debug your driver program. You can test if the received data is as expected or transfer the move command to see if it is moving as what you want.
xbot_driver is also a pure c++ program which means that you can run it as a c++ program or you can choose the ROS way to execute it.

## xbot_keyop
The package for teleoperate xbot in your computer. Just follow the direction info once the program launched and shown in screen.

## xbot_msgs
All of the message types that xbot publishes and subscribes. You can define your own message types in this package.
